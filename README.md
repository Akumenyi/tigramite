## General Notes

TIGRAMITE is a time series analysis python module. With flexibly adaptable scripts it allows to reconstruct graphical models (conditional independence graphs) from discrete or continuously-valued time series based on a causal discovery algorithm and create high-quality plots of the results.


## Features

- different conditional independence test statistics adapted to
  continuously-valued or discrete data, and different assumptions about
  linear or nonlinear dependencies
- hyperparameter optimization
- easy parallelization
- handling of masked time series data
- false discovery control and confidence interval estimation


## Required python packages

- numpy, tested with Version 1.10
- scipy, tested with Version 0.17
- sklearn, tested with Version 0.18 (optional, necessary for GPACE test)
- ace python package (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ace/0.3) OR rpy2 and R-package 'acepack' (optional, necessary for GPACE test)
- matplotlib, tested with Version 1.5
- networkx, tested with Version 1.10
- basemap (only if plotting on a map is needed)
- mpi4py (optional, necessary for using the parallelized implementation)
- cython (optional, necessary for CMIknn test)
- statsmodels, tested with Version 0.6 (optional, necessary for p-value corrections)
